This is react website made with NEWS api.

A news application built using ReactJS (Reusable Component) and [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) that helps list and preview news articles from various sources as well as display latest and trending news on the home page. Get up-to-date breaking news and articles from news sources and blogs all over the web.
You will need an API key from https://newsapi.org.
Please look at their [documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs) to see how to use the API.  

Once you have the API, goto 'src/api/index.js' and paste your API key.

I was add new feature in this site theme changer.

if you use [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) developer subscription then you can run this api only localhost. If you can use this api in live project then you can purchase paid api of [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

Thank You!!!
